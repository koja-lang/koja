//! Value-semantics drop glue. Implements the reference-counting
//! baseline: every binding, parameter, and return *acquires* an owned
//! value ([`IRInstruction::Clone`]), so each owner holds storage it can
//! unconditionally release at scope exit ([`IRInstruction::DropLocal`]
//! / [`IRInstruction::DropValue`]).
//!
//! Lowering emits these `Clone` / `Drop` markers for every
//! [`IRType::is_heap_managed`] type; what each lowers to is decided
//! downstream:
//!
//! - **heap leaf** (`String` / `Binary` / `Bits`): an inline `rc++` /
//!   `rc--` on the `[i64 rc][i64 bit_length][payload]` block — immutable
//!   blocks are shared rather than deep-copied, immortal rodata literals
//!   carry a sentinel rc so inc/dec are no-ops.
//! - **composite** (`List` / `Map` / `Set` / struct / enum / union /
//!   boxed `Indirect`): the [`crate::elaborate`] sub-pass rewrites the
//!   marker into a synthesized `clone_T` / `drop_T` call — or, for an
//!   all-`Copy` aggregate that needs no glue, the backend renders the
//!   `Clone` as a register copy and the `Drop` as a no-op.
//! - **closure** (`Function`): an inline `rc++` / `rc--` on the env
//!   block, the `rc--` running the body's capture-release glue at zero
//!   (see `crate::lower::closures` and `FunctionKind::DropClosureGlue`).
//!
//! Three lowering-side primitives:
//!
//! - [`materialize_owned`] — acquire a value at an ownership boundary.
//! - [`emit_slot_drops`] — release every heap-managed local at a
//!   control-flow exit.
//! - [`drop_discarded_temp`] — release an owned value whose statement
//!   result is thrown away.
